‌The rule will be applied to the next OwlCheck run on that particular dataset.‌

#### **Rule Types** <a id="HRuleTypes"></a>

1. When to use a simple rule:
   * Simple rules would be applied to filter a condition on a single column in a single table.
   * Example: city = 'Baltimore'
2. When to use a freeform sql rule:
   * ​Complex \(freeform sql\) would be used when applying a condition across multiple tables/columns and generally when more flexibility/customization is desired.
   * ​Example: select \* from dataset where name = 'Owl'
3. When to use a preset rule:
   * Preset rules would be used for quickly adding strict condition check. Commonly used conditions are available to add to any dataset columns.‌

All built-in spark functions are available to use. \([https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/api/sql/](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.0/api/sql/)\) for simple and freeform sql rules.‌

#### **Points and Percentage** <a id="HPointsandPercentage"></a>

For every percentage the X condition occurs, deduct Y points from the data quality score. If a rule was triggered 10 times out of 100 rows, break records occurred 10% of the time. If you input 1 point for every 1 percent, 10 points would be deducted from the overall score.‌

#### **Creating Your First Rule** <a id="HCreatingYourFirstRule"></a>

Let’s create a simple rule using the below information. The dataset name.

1. Search for “shape\_example” and click “Load”
2. Select “Simple Rule”
3. Rule Name = lnametest
4. @shape\_example.lname = “hootbeck” \(should hit one time day over day\).
5. Points = 1
6. Percentage = 1
7. Click “Submit”
